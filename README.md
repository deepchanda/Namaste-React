# About the course
The mission of this course is to take you from Zero to Hero in React. During this 2-month journey, you will learn everything in live classes and then implement it by building projects. You’ll learn how to start with React and build up to dynamic user interfaces. You’ll work with React-specific concepts like JSX, components, state, props, hooks, and more. Take this course to gain an edge as an industry ready web developer.

The curriculum is designed with the principle of `learn by building`, so there will be a lot of Assignments/Projects you will work on. After this Bootcamp, you will be able to develop fast and scalable react frontend web applications from scratch.
